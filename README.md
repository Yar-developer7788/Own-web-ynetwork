# Own-web-ynetwork

Hello everyone! I created my own web. This is my biggest project! You can support me with a donation here: [Donate](https://www.donationalerts.com/r/yar_developer) . So, let's get started. You can publish your site based on the template that I provided in this repository. To publish a site, write to me in discord: [Discord](https://discord.com/users/1136336238564081815) , I remind you, the site must match the template! Otherwise, the site will not be published! There will be several free domains. You need to pay for your domain.
